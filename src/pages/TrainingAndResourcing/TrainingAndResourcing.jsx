          <p>
            People with disabilities are considered one of the world’s largest
            under-represented groups. The church is largely unprepared for the
            burgeoning disabled population. Have you ever suffered physically,
            emotionally, or spiritually and wondered why? Do you have family
            members or friends with disabilities and struggle to know what to
            say or how to act around them?
          </p>

          <br /> Beyond Suffering Course has been designed by the Joni and
          Friends Ministry (USA) to explore the problem of suffering in general
          and then to examine ways in which the disability community provides
          the church with a dynamic model of spiritual transformation.
