              <h1>Meet Olufunke Adeloye</h1>
              <p>
                Olufunke is the founder of OAKONSULT DISABILITIES OUTREACH
                (OAKONSULT). She strongly believes in the difference the
                ‘God-factor’ makes in caring roles and is passionate about
                Carers finding fulfillment at whatever stage they are at in
                their individual journeys. Olufunke speaks from the heart and
                draws extensively from her walk with the Lord as a Carer,
                sharing the love of Christ among families within this sphere. In
                addition to her caring role, Olufunke is a Beyond Suffering
                Course Instructor with the Joni & Friends Ministry (USA),
                certified Personal Development Coach from the Coaching Academy,
                UK, and a Public Speaker.
                <br />
                <br />
                Olufunke had her career background in both specialist and
                generalist roles in human resource practicing across the
                educational, banking, consulting, and telecommunications
                sectors. She made a transition into the field of disabilities
                due to her personal life experience, working within the third
                sector industry, to support families of children and young
                people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.

                Seamlessly combining transferable skills from her experience
                with her latest career move, she empowers parents/carers with
                essential information and vital tools needed to support them as
                they continue the enormous task of providing care for their
                children and young people with disabilities. She recently had
                the privilege to lead on a policy implementation project of the
                Children and Families Act 2014 which brought a needed change to
                the type of support available to children with Special
                Educational Needs in the UK.
